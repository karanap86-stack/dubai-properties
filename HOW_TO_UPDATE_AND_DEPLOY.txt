How to Update and Deploy Your Project (GitHub + Netlify)
=========================================================

1. Open a terminal and navigate to your project folder:
   cd C:\Users\User\src

2. Make your code changes as needed.

3. Stage all changes for commit:
   git add .

4. Commit your changes (replace the message with your own):
   git commit -m "Describe your changes"

5. Push your changes to GitHub:
   git push

When to use these commands:
- Use steps 1–5 every time you want to update your code and deploy the latest version to Netlify.
- Netlify will automatically deploy your latest code after each push to GitHub.

Environment Variables:
- Set secrets or API keys in the Netlify dashboard (Site Settings > Environment Variables).
- Do not commit .env files to GitHub.

Troubleshooting:
- If deployment fails, check build logs in Netlify.
- Ensure all dependencies are in package.json.

You can copy and paste these commands and instructions directly into your email or documentation!
